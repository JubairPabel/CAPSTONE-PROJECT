# CAPSTONE-PROJECT
Our company DITES (Development Institute of Technical Education and Skill) comes from a background of young technology enthusiasts who believe there is not enough options in early education to prepare for a career in IT. Our goal is to provide early education to high school age students who are eager to get a jump start on learning about the technology that helps us all in our daily lives. We have realized that early education institutes do not provide adequate options for these students and hope to be able to fill that void. We would like to give these students proper knowledge and training in these fields so that they may go on to succeed in further education and have fulfilling careers.
